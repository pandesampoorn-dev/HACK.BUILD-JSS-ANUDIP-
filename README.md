Frontend: React (using Hooks like useState, useMemo, and useEffect for state management)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (for a modern, responsive, utility-first design)

Backend (Planned): This frontend is designed to connect to a Spring Boot REST API for persistent data (projects, users, etc.). Currently, it operates in a standalone mode with mock data.
